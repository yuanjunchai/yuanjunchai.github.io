- Uncovered and analyzed the "Artificial Hivemind" effect, demonstrating significant intra-model repetition and inter-model homogeneity in current language models. Introduced $\infty$-Chats, the first large-scale (26K queries) dataset of real-world open-ended user queries, and developed a comprehensive taxonomy (6 categories, 17 subcategories) for LLM prompts.

<!-- - We propose the **Robust-VLGuard dataset** and **DiffPure-VLM** defense framework to address the problem that visual language models (VLMs) are vulnerable to Gaussian noise and adversarial perturbation attacks. Through fine-tuning with Gaussian noise enhancement, the attack success rate of VLMs on datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet is significantly reduced (for example, the attack success rate of MiniGPT-4 in the RealToxicityPrompts benchmark test dropped from 44.1% to 16.5%). Combined with the distribution conversion capability of the diffusion model DiffPure, adversarial noise is converted into Gaussian noise, further improving the defense effect, especially under strong attacks (for example, the attack success rate of InternVL2 dropped from 57.3% to 36.1% when ϵ=64/255). -->
<!-- - We notice Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are surprisingly vulnerable to "jailbreak attacks," especially when faced with noisy images or simple Gaussian noise perturbations. To address it, we propose Robust-VLGuard (a new multimodal safety dataset) and DiffPure-VLM (a novel defense framework). -->
- Our **Robust-VLGuard** dataset and **DiffPure-VLM** defense framework tackle the vulnerability of visual language models (VLMs) to adversarial perturbation attacks. By combining Gaussian noise enhancement and diffusion model-based adversarial noise conversion, we demonstrably improve VLM robustness, even against strong attacks.

[**IKC: Blind Super-Resolution With Iterative Kernel Correction**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03377.pdf)

- Our innovative Iterative Kernel Correction (IKC) method tackles blind super-resolution by leveraging characteristic artifacts from kernel mismatch to refine blur kernel estimations. This, combined with our SFTMD network architecture utilizing spatial feature transform layers, delivers enhanced performance across various blur conditions. The code implementation is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/yuanjunchai/IKC).

<!-- - We introduce the Iterative Kernel Correction (IKC) method, which identifies and rectifies blur kernel inaccuracies to achieve superior results in blind super-resolution, further enhanced by our SFTMD network for diverse blur kernels. -->
<!-- - We propose an Iterative Kernel Correction (IKC) method for blur kernel estimation in blind SR problem, where the blur kernels are unknown. We draw the observation that kernel mismatch could bring regular artifacts (either over-sharpening or over-smoothing), which can be applied to correct inaccurate blur kernels. Thus we introduce an iterative correction scheme – IKC that achieves better results than direct kernel estimation. We further propose an effective SR network architecture using spatial feature transform (SFT) layers to handle multiple blur kernels, named SFTMD. -->
